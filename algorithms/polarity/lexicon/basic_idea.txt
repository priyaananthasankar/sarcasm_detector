1. For each word in tweet:
	find if word is positive or negative:
		if found:
			assign p or n with the word

	seed_word,p/n

	for rest of the words in tweet after seed_word:
		calculate bi grams i bigram_arr
		for each bigrams in bigram_arr:
			textblob(sentiment)
			majority of pos/neg scores for each bigram

	majority = pos/neg

	from p it it changed to neg - sarcasm
	from n it changed to pos - sarcasm
